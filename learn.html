`Hello my dear! So, let’s talk about something every girl goes through — your period. A period is when blood comes out of your body through the vagina. Don’t be afraid — it’s not because you are hurt. It happens because your body is changing and growing into a woman.

This usually starts between the ages of 9 and 13. Some girls may start earlier, some later — and that’s all okay. When your period comes, it may last for about 3 to 7 days. You’ll see blood on your panties, and it may feel strange at first — but it’s a good sign that your body is healthy.`

`Think of it like this: each month, your body is preparing a soft place inside (the womb or uterus) in case a baby will grow there one day. If there is no baby, your body cleans out that soft lining, and that comes out as blood. That’s your period.

It’s like when you prepare a guest room — if no one comes, you clean it up and start fresh next month!`

You can keep a calendar or use a small notebook to write down:
\t•\tThe day your period starts 🗓️
\t•\tHow many days it lasts
\t•\tIf you felt pain (cramps), sadness, tiredness
\t•\tHow heavy the bleeding was

This is your personal health book! Some girls even use stickers or beads to mark their days. It’s simple, and it helps you understand your body better.`

\t•\tTiredness, or a bloated stomach
\t•\tHeadaches or back pain

🌿 What helps? You can use a warm cloth or bottle on your stomach. Drink warm tea like ginger or sobolo. Rest when needed and try gentle walks.

\t•\tWash yourself with clean water. Don’t put soap inside — just outside

\t•\tPlanning ahead for school, sports, or church events
\t•\tUnderstanding why you feel moody or tired some days

Use a small diary 📖 or calendar. Mark the first day of your period, how long it lasted, and how you felt.
For example:
\t•\t“Started bleeding July 5th”
\t•\t“Had cramps, felt tired on Day 1”
\t•\t“Bleeding stopped on July 9th”

🩸 Menstruation (Day 1–5) – This is when your period happens. You may feel tired or in pain. Rest, drink warm things, and be gentle with yourself.

🌱 Follicular Phase (Day 1–14) – Your body is rebuilding strength. You may feel energetic, focused, and creative. This is a good time to learn, do chores, or take on projects.

🥚 Ovulation (Around Day 14) – Your body releases an egg. You might notice wetness in your underwear (like egg white). You may also feel confident, attractive, or excited.

🌙 Luteal Phase (Day 15–28) – Your energy may drop. You might feel moody, bloated, or sleepy. This is your body preparing for your next period.

1. Menstrual Phase (Days 1–5)
* The uterine lining sheds — this is your period.
* Estrogen and progesterone are at their lowest.
* You may feel fatigued, introverted, or low-energy.
2. Follicular Phase (Days 1–14, overlaps with menstruation)
* Hormones begin to rise, prepping your body to release an egg.
* You may notice clearer skin, boosted mood, and rising energy.
3. Ovulation (Around Day 14)
* One mature egg is released.
* Some women feel more confident or social, and may notice slippery, egg-white discharge.
4. Luteal Phase (Days 15–28)
* Hormones peak and then drop if no pregnancy occurs.
* This is when PMS symptoms (bloating, irritability, cravings) may show up.
